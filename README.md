**HEART ATTACK MONITOR**
**Tech Stack: Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok, Power BI Service (real-time updates)**


Given my family's history of high blood pressure, I wanted to see how machine learning and data visualization could provide insights into risk assessment.
→ Built an ML model to predict heart health risks. (Gradient Boosting Classifier from scikit-learn (sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier), optimized with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV)
→ Developed a Flask API that takes user input from a website and delivers real-time predictions.
→ Integrated with Power BI, where incoming data is visualized for better insights.
→ Tested ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok in the process—I was particularly impressed with Grok’s capabilities!

Attached is layout of what the project does.
